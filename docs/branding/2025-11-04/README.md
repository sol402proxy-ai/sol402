# 4 Nov 2025 – Branding Audit Screenshots

Captured 1440×900 desktop snapshots for every public route to identify where the circular Sol402 logomark can sit without crowding existing copy. All images live alongside this file.

| Page | Screenshot | Initial logo placement thoughts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Home (`/`) | `home-1440x900.png` | Hero’s left column has vertical space above the headline; footer left card could host logomark at ~56 px. |
| Pricing (`/pricing`) | `pricing-1440x900.png` | Pricing hero capsule supports a floating badge near the “Usage-based billing” label. |
| Token (`/token`) | `token-1440x900.png` | Token hero stack can feature the logo above the SOL402 symbol callout; roadmap CTA panel also has margin for a watermark. |
| Docs (`/docs/quickstart`) | `docs-quickstart-1440x900.png` | Add a subtle logo to the code snippet header or the resources grid intro. |
| Link Builder (`/link/request`) | `link-request-1440x900.png` | Place the mark inside the hero glass card beside “Launch your pay-per-request link”. |
| Dashboard (`/dashboard`) | `dashboard-1440x900.png` | Insert a small logo chip in the greeting card and consider using it as an icon for SOL402 balance. |
| API (`/api`) | `api-1440x900.png` | Top hero masthead can display the logo in the gradient background without conflicting with CTA buttons. |
| Demo (`/demo`) | `demo-1440x900.png` | Embed the logo above the example workflow diagram. |
| FAQ (`/faq`) | `faq-1440x900.png` | Intro header has spare space for a 48 px mark next to the title. |
| Terms (`/legal/terms`) | `legal-terms-1440x900.png` | Use a monochrome logo in the document header for visual consistency. |
| Privacy (`/legal/privacy`) | `legal-privacy-1440x900.png` | Mirror the terms treatment with a subdued logomark. |
| Changelog (`/changelog`) | `changelog-1440x900.png` | Add an inline logo beside the “Latest updates” heading. |
| Status (`/status`) | `status-1440x900.png` | Place the logo within the hero status indicator for brand recognition. |

Next step: integrate the provided `Sol402_bg.png` asset (likely resized for hero usage) using the notes above, prioritising home/pricing/token pages first.
