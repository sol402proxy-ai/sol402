## Summary
- Status: Pass with follow-ups
- Highlights / blockers: Home experience matches the redesign copy and CTA map. All primary links route correctly. Remaining placeholders (hero metrics, steps visual artwork) are intentional until Phase 4 assets land. Could not run Lighthouse or cross-browser sweeps inside the CLI environment.

## Checks
- Accessibility: Not run (requires Lighthouse + screen reader in GUI environment).
- Performance: `npm run build` passes; full Lighthouse perf audit deferred to Phase 4B.
- Browsers: Manual HTML review only; no live browser matrix executed.
- Content: ✅ CTAs (`/link/request`, `/docs/quickstart`, `/demo`, `/dashboard`) verified in markup. Social icons limited to Dexscreener/GitHub/X. Contact email confirmed as `admin@sol402.app`. No lorem ipsum discovered.
- Deployment: `npm run build` succeeds; deploy steps queued for later phases.

## Action Items
1. Replace the `steps-visual--placeholder` block with final artwork once Phase 4 assets are ready.
2. Capture responsive screenshots (devices listed in `docs/QA_CHECKLIST.md`) when GUI access is available.
3. Schedule Lighthouse accessibility + performance run during Phase 4B comprehensive QA.
